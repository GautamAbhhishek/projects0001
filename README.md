Man down technology, also known as fall detection.
# Fall Detection using Pose Estimation and Machine Learning

This project aims to detect human falls in real-time using video input by leveraging pose estimation and a machine learning classifier. It is designed to aid in monitoring elderly or at-risk individuals and to improve response times in the event of an accident.

##  Project Description

Falls are a major health risk, particularly among the elderly. Detecting falls automatically can help prevent serious injuries or even fatalities. This project uses computer vision techniques and pose estimation to identify whether a fall has occurred based on body posture dynamics from video feeds.

## âš™ How It Works

1. **Video Input**:
   - Load a pre-recorded video or stream from a webcam.
   
2. **Pose Estimation**:
   - Extract 33 human body landmarks using **MediaPipe**.
   
3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Convert keypoints into a vector of distances, angles, or relative positions.

4. **Classification**:
   - Pass the feature vector to a trained ML model (e.g., SVM or RandomForest) to classify the action as `fall` or `no fall`.

5. **Result Output**:
   - Overlay the video frame with a fall warning when detected.
   - Optionally save or stream alerts.
